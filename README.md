# Terraform AWS Complex Infrastructure

This repository demonstrates complex real-world scenarios and challenges when working with Terraform and AWS. It's structured to progressively introduce complexity through different feature branches.

## Project Structure

```
terraform-aws-complex/
├── main.tf           # Main Terraform configuration
├── variables.tf      # Input variables
├── outputs.tf        # Output values
├── modules/         # Reusable modules
└── environments/    # Environment-specific configurations
```

## Branches

Each branch introduces new concepts and complexity:

1. `main` - Basic VPC infrastructure
2. `feature/state-management` - Remote state and state locking
3. `feature/network-expansion` - Complex networking setup
4. `feature/security` - Security groups, KMS, and IAM
5. `feature/application-layer` - EC2, Auto Scaling, and Load Balancing
6. `feature/multi-environment` - Multi-environment setup and tagging

## Prerequisites

- Terraform >= 1.0
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Git

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/satishgonella2024/terraform-aws-complex.git
   cd terraform-aws-complex
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Create a terraform.tfvars file with your values:
   ```hcl
   aws_region = "your-preferred-region"
   project_name = "your-project-name"
   environment = "dev"
   ```

4. Review and apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
